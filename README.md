# Code to Tracedata

I've attached 2 different projects.

## Project 1 - Experimental Full Stack _Small_ Project

This a Experimental Full Stack (_Small_) Project that provides information about the weather through user's location. It also provides information of at least 5 cities and show the next 5 days weather information.

*<<< My idea is to mix `Classes` and `Hooks` >>>*

Extra info:
- _No implemented boilerplates, *all by myself*. Included Webpack_
- Developed in 3 days
- Server: The small server has been implemented like a bridge between Client and Weather API and not a FULL REST API.

Stack:
- *Typescript + TSLint*
- *ReactJS + Redux + Router*
- *SASS + BEM*
- *JEST*
- *Webpack*
- *Babel*
- *Express*

## Project 2 - Handmade CLI (mostly in Bash) 2017-2018 developed to : I've developed this CLI to help my team to avoid running manually tasks . At that moment, no official React CLI had been released, only CRA.

What you can do (React)? 
It has a React module for creating all type of components, Container, Class and Functional, with all those related files (reducer, actions, styles, test) and syncronized them to the Application.

Rest all modules: FTP, GIT and SASS
